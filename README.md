# GitHub Contribution API

Since the github api does not offer any means to retrieve a user's list of contributions, I put together a webscraper that uploads your contribution to google drive. 
This project forks from (GitHub Contribution Chart)[https://github.com/sallar/github-contributions-chart] and modifies into a working tool that uploads to Google Drives.
In addition, this project is written in typescript. 

## Set Up
- Follow (Node.js QuickStart)[https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/nodejs] to set up your project in Google Cloud
- Modify variables within src/index.ts to replace it with your variables.

### Installation
```
npm install
```

### run
```
npm run dev
```
